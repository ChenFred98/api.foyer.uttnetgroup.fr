ETU_BASEURL=https://etu.utt.fr
# Setup Etu Application :
# Go to https://etu.utt.fr/api/panel and create an application
* Name is what appear when logging in
* Redirection URL MUST BE localhost:3000/api/v1/etuutt/redirect, it redirects to the API not the front ! So put this app's url (for local use it's localhost:3000 by default, but in prod it could be api.yourapp.com or whatever)
* image is optional but swag

# Go to your application created, get the id and secret and set it :
ETU_CLIENT_ID=
ETU_CLIENT_SECRET=
ETU_CLIENT_ID=public
# Finally, setup the redirect url, where this app should redirect user at the end, it's the baseurl of the front : 
LOGIN_REDIRECT_URL=http://localhost:8080
